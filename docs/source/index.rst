Welcome to Pyscandl's documentation!
************************************

Introduction
============

Pyscandl is a python programe made to be able to download scans of mangas and webtoons on multiple different websites without the need for `selenium <https://www.selenium.dev/>`_ and its `python version <https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/>`_.

The currently supported websites are `Fanfox <https://fanfox.net>`_ who also own the mangazone app, `Mangadex <https://mangadex.com>`_ and `NHentai <https://nhentai.net>`_.

.. warning::
   | *Don't overuse this tool.*
   | *Support the developers of those websites by disabling your adblock on their site. Advertisments pay for the website servers.*
   | *Get the mangas from official retailers when they are accessible in your country !*
