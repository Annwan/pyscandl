# pyscandl
**DISCLAIMER:** This project is just a technical demo, don't download scans and get the mangas from official retailers when they are accessible in your country

This modular program to be able to download manga and webtoon scans from the internet, it'll use an image fetcher specific for each website while respecting an API.  
The API will enable you to create your own image fetchers for other websites not supported yet by the program.  
There is a `banlist/` folder where you can place the images you don't want to appear in your pdf.

## installation

```
cd path/to/project/root
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5) install `nodejs`
6) you can now use the program

### from release
1) check if you have `python3.7` installed

2) check if you have `pip` for python3.7 installed

4) install the dependencies for the program
```
cd path/to/project/root
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5) install `nodejs`
6) you can now use the program  
**you'll need to download each release from the [release page](https://github.com/Ara0n/pyscandl/release)**

## requirements
This is a python3 program that uses:
- the dependencies in `requirements.txt`
- `nodejs` for `fanfox` and `cfscrape`

It is developed on a Debian testing (currently Bullseye) computer so it is verified for Debian and should work at least for the older debians and the debian-likes, provided that you have the dependencies listed up above.  
As for other linux distribution, windows and MacOSX I haven't tested the compatibility *(windows may be tested later down the run)* but it should work if you have all the dependencies.

## command line interface

## image fetcher API
`fetcher(self, link:str=None, manga:str=None, chapstart:int=1):`
### args
- `link=`: link to the manga you initialize the fetcher to
- `manga=`: manga name used to initialize to
- `chapstart=`: chapter on which the fetcher is initialized on
**you MUST give either a `link` or `manga` when initializing**

### API usage
- `.next_image()` changes `.image` to the next in the chapter  
- `.go_to_chapter(chap)` goes to the chapter `chap`
- `.next_chapter()` changes `.image` to the first in the next chapter
- `.is_last_image()` which returns `True` if it's the last page of the chapter
- `.is_last_chapter()` which returns `True` if it's the last chapter available 
- `quit()` to close properly the fetcher
- `.author` string with the name of the author, defaults to `"TBD"` if nothing is found
- `.chapter_number` is an `int` (or a `float` if the chapter is an extra) containing the number of the chapter or the current `.image`
- `.chapter_name` is a `string` containing the title of the chapter of the current `.image` (the `string` is empty if no name is detected) 
- `.domain` a `string` with the website domain, format is: `.domname.ext`
- `.ext` string with the image extension name
- `.image` is a `string` with link to the image  
- `.manga_name` is a `string` with the complete name of the manga or the webtoon of the current `.image`
- `.npage` is an `int` giving the current page of the fetcher
- `standalone` is a `bool` signaling if true that it doesn't support multiple chapters (the verbose and save paths/names wont have mentions of chapters) **/!\\ it's a class attribute /!\\**
- needs to raise the `MangaNotFound` exception from `exceptions` if the manga is not found

## Pyscandl()
`Pyscandl(self, fetcher, chapstart:int=1, output:str=".", keepimage:bool=False, all:bool=False, link:str=None, manga:str=None, download_number:int=1, quiet:bool=False, start:int=0, tiny:bool=False)`

### args and kwargs
- `fetcher` will be the fetcher object used in this instance, there will be an `enum` with all the fetchers available (I strongly recommend if you make your own fetcher to place it in the enum too)
- `chapstart=` is an `int` (or a `float` in case of extra chapters) for the starting point of the fetching
- `output=` determines the output folder for the pdfs and the images (if kept)
- `keepimage=` determines if the images are downloaded instead of loaded into the RAM
- `all=` determines if you need to download all the available chapters or not
- `link=` **required if not using `manga=`**, is a `string` containing the link to the root page with the list of all the chapters
- `manga=` **required if not using `link=`**, is a `string` containing the complete manga name
- `download_number=` **required if `all=False`**, is an `int` containing the number of chapters we need to download
- `quiet=` deactivates the verbose while downloading

### API usage
- `.create_pdf()` creates the pdf of the last chapter where `.full_chapter()` or `.keep_full_chapter()` was used
- `.full_download()` does the full download with the specified parameters when initialising
- `.full_chapter()` fetches the complete chapter
- `.go_to_chapter(chap)` goes to the chapter `chap`
- `.keep_full_chapter()` download the images of the chapter (like with the `-k` option)
- `.next_chapter()` goes to the next available chapter
- `.fetcher` where the corresponding fetcher is stored, usefull if conversing with it directly
